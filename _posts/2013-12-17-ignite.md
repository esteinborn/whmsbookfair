title: The Design Studio Method - NY Innovates DevCon 2013 Ignite Talk
---

Thanks for attending my Ignite talk about Design Studio. 5 minutes is not a lot of time to explain it in much detail. So here is all of the research I did on the topic. Hopefully you will be able to use these resources to run your own design studio.

Heres a video of the presentation:
