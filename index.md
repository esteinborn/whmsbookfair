      <p class="lead">This year we’re partnering with The Open Door Book Store to bring the Book Fair online!</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>In the following pages you can see previews of the books we’re looking at this year. And we’ll talk about them, together! Join us on the pages separated by school level. Our partners at Open Door have curated a list of amazing and popular books for us this year, and you can find them all, safely, here! And once you find them we have the links to buy them from Open Door, all to help promote reading AND raise money for new books for our school!</p>
